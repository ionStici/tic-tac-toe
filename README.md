## About the Project

Dive into the classic game of strategy with a modern twist in the **"Tic Tac Toe"** challenge from Frontend Mentor. Crafted with React and supercharged by Vite, this project brings the timeless game to life with flair.

While the game's implementation might be from a bygone era of my coding journey, it still offers a robust challenge, especially on hard mode where the system's moves are calculated with precision.
